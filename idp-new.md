# What is an IDP?

An **International Driving Permit (IDP)** is recognized internationally and allows the motorist to drive a motor vehicle without further formality.

It is available to **Ugandan Residents** with a current full Ugandan Driving License. Each license is valid for **one year from the date of issue**.

## Benefits of IDP

- **Hassle-free driving across borders**  
  An IDP, being international, is recognized worldwide. Holders don't need to obtain separate driving permits to drive an appropriate vehicle in the foreign country they are visiting. This makes it very convenient whenever you travel.

- **No further lessons or tests**  
  All holders of Ugandan driving permits are eligible for an IDP. At AAU, we honor your Ugandan driving permit as proof of your driving proficiency. You don’t need to undergo further lessons or tests.  
  Just make your application and start driving across the border without much worry.

## Notes

- If you travel to any country for longer than three months, to take up residence or employment, or for any reason other than tourism, you should inquire about your personal position before relying on a permit.  
- You may still be required to produce your local license for inspection when hiring a car overseas. It is recommended that you **always carry your local license**, even when an international permit is held.  
- International Driving Permits cannot be issued to holders of provisional licenses.  
- It is important to check the accuracy of the personal information printed on your driving license. If there are any errors, or if you change your name or address, you should immediately notify the authority that issued your license.
