const validateForm = useCallback((): FormErrors => {
  // Individual field validation with specific error messages
  // Phone number validation with country-specific rules
  // Email validation with proper regex
  // Required field validation with user-friendly messages
}, [formState, recaptchaValue, validatePhoneNumber]);
```

### Event Handlers
```typescript
// Optimized event handlers with useCallback
const handleSubmit = useCallback(async (event: React.FormEvent) => {
