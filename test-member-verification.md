# Member Verification Implementation - Test Guide

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the AA membership verification functionality in the IDP application form. Here's what was added:

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Detection & Debounced Verification**
- When a user enters a membership number, the system waits 2 seconds after they stop typing
- Then automatically calls `getAAUMemberByNumber()` to verify the membership
- Shows loading states during verification

### 2. **Manual Verification Button**
- If user wants to verify immediately, they can click the verification button
- Button appears when there's a membership number that hasn't been verified yet

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- ‚úÖ **Success State**: Green checkmark icon, success alert with member name
- ‚ùå **Error State**: Red error alert with retry button
- ‚è≥ **Loading State**: Spinner and "Verifying..." message
- üîç **Verification Button**: PersonSearch icon for manual verification

### 4. **Auto-Population of Form Fields**
When a member is successfully verified, the following fields are automatically populated:
- **Personal Info**: `surname`, `otherNames`, `dateOfBirth`, `placeOfBirth`
- **Contact Info**: `emailAddress`, `telephoneNumber`, `mobileNumber`, `postalAddress`, `residentialAddress`, `streetRoadPlot`
- **Documents**: `passportNumber`
- **Driving License**: `ugandaDrivingPermitNumber`, `expiryDateOfDrivingPermit`, `classesOfDrivingPermit`

### 5. **Enhanced UX Indicators**
- Auto-filled fields show "(Auto-filled)" in their labels
- Green helper text indicates the field was populated from membership record
- Small green checkmark icons on auto-filled fields
- Tooltips explain the auto-fill functionality

## Code Changes Made

### Hook (`useApplyForIdp.ts`)
- Added `memberVerificationState` to track verification status
- Added `verifyMembershipNumber()` function with error handling
- Added `handleManualMemberVerification()` for button clicks
- Added `populateFormWithMemberData()` to fill form fields
- Added `handleMembershipNumberChange()` with debounce logic
- Added cleanup for debounce timers

### Component (`ApplyForIdp.tsx`)
- Enhanced membership number field with verification UI
- Added loading spinner, success/error alerts
- Added manual verification button
- Updated personal info fields (surname, otherNames) with auto-fill indicators
- Updated contact fields (emailAddress, telephoneNumber) with auto-fill indicators
- Added proper TypeScript imports for new icons

## User Experience Flow

1. **User selects "Yes, I am an AA member"**
2. **Membership number field appears**
3. **User types membership number**
4. **System shows verification button and starts 2-second countdown**
5. **Auto-verification happens OR user clicks verify button**
6. **Loading spinner shows "Verifying membership number..."**
7. **On success**: 
   - Green success alert shows member name
   - All available fields auto-populate
   - Fields show "(Auto-filled)" indicators
8. **On error**:
   - Red error alert with specific error message
   - Retry button to attempt verification again

## Error Handling

- **Invalid number format**: "Please enter a valid membership number"
- **Member not found**: "No member found with AA membership number: [number]"
- **Database errors**: Specific error messages from the API
- **Network errors**: Generic error with retry option

## Performance Optimizations

- **Debounced API calls**: Prevents excessive API requests while typing
- **Cached verification**: Won't re-verify the same number unnecessarily
- **Loading states**: Clear feedback prevents user confusion
- **Memory cleanup**: Proper cleanup of timers and event listeners

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with valid membership numbers** from your database
2. **Test with invalid numbers** (non-existent, malformed)
3. **Test the debounce behavior** (type, wait, see auto-verification)
4. **Test manual verification button**
5. **Verify all form fields populate correctly**
6. **Test error states and retry functionality**
7. **Test form submission** with auto-filled data

The implementation provides a smooth, professional user experience with comprehensive error handling and visual feedback.
