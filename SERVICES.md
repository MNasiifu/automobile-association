# Vehicle Valuation Services

## Summary

## What we do
At the Automobile Association of Uganda (AAU) we provide independent, market-aware vehicle valuations tailored to Uganda’s motoring environment. A valuation establishes a vehicle’s monetary value at a specific date and for a defined purpose whether for insurance, sale, finance, fleet management or legal matters. Our reports combine physical inspection, market benchmarking and practical recommendations so you get clear, defensible figures you can rely on.

## Why valuation matters
- Sets the correct sum insured (avoids under/over-insurance).  
- Informs fair buying and selling decisions.  
- Supports finance, lease and probate requirements.  
- Provides evidence in claims, disputes and accident investigations.  
- Helps fleet owners manage depreciation and maintenance budgeting.  

## Our valuation services
We offer a full suite of vehicle inspection and valuation services designed for individuals, insurers, financiers and fleet operators:

- **Pre-Insurance Valuation**  
  Independent market valuation to determine an accurate sum insured before a policy is issued.

- **Technical Brief Valuation**  
  Concise, insurer-friendly technical summaries that highlight condition, defects and market value for quick decisioning.

- **Comprehensive Mechanical Valuation (Light & Heavy Vehicles)**  
  Full mechanical inspection and condition report for cars, pickups and commercial vehicles includes inspection findings, estimated repair costs and a market value assessment.

- **Accident Damage Assessment & Loss Evaluation**  
  Rapid on-site or workshop assessment after a collision: damage report, repair estimate, salvage recommendation and total-loss guidance.

- **Pre-Loss Condition Report (Pre-Theft / Pre-Fire)**  
  Baseline condition documentation to protect owners and help expedite future claims or disputes.

- **Component-Level Inspection & Certification**  
  Focused checks on engines, gearboxes, chassis, electrical systems and odometer verification with a certificate of inspection.

- **Specialist & Non-Standard Inspections**  
  For modified vehicles, classic cars, imports, rebuilt titles, or any non-standard case requiring specialist expertise.

- **Fleet Valuation & Audit Solutions**  
  Tailored programmes for fleet owners: bulk valuations, depreciation schedules, audit-ready reports and periodic re-valuations.

## What a typical AAU valuation report includes
- Executive summary and declared purpose.  
- Market value, replacement/insured value and salvage indication.  
- Condition notes and photographed evidence.  
- Technical findings and repair cost estimates (where applicable).

# International Driving Permit
An International Driving Permit (IDP) is an official translation of your Ugandan driving licence that lets you drive legally when travelling abroad. Designed to be used alongside your Ugandan licence, an IDP is recognised in many countries worldwide (typically over 150) and is issued in multiple languages to help local authorities read your driving credentials.

## Why get an IDP?
- Drive with confidence when travelling for work or leisure.  
- Avoid delays or misunderstandings with foreign traffic authorities.  
- Useful for car hire companies that require an internationally recognised document.  

## Who should apply?
Any Ugandan licence holder planning to drive overseas — especially if you’re hiring a car, staying for more than a short visit, or travelling to countries that specifically request an IDP.

## Validity
IDPs are usually valid for one to three years, depending on the issuing rules. Always carry your Ugandan driving licence together with the IDP.

## Documents required
Bring the following when applying:
- Your valid Ugandan driving licence (original).  
- Valid passport (original) and a clear photocopy.  
- National ID (original) and a copy.  
- Two recent passport-size photos.  
- Payment of the prescribed application fee.  

## How AA Uganda can help
The Automobile Association of Uganda offers guidance and application support to make the IDP process smooth:
- Pre-checks of your documents to ensure your application is complete.  
- Assistance with the online application or in-person submission at AA Uganda branches.  
- Advice on country-specific driving requirements and paperwork to carry while abroad.  

## How to apply
1. Gather the documents listed above.  
2. Visit your nearest AA Uganda office or apply through the AA Uganda online portal (where available).  
3. Pay the prescribed fee and complete the application form.  
4. Receive your IDP — processing time can vary, so check with your local AA Uganda branch for current turnaround times.
