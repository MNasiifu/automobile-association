# CORS Fix Verification

## Problem Identified
The CORS error `"Failed to process IDP application: Invalid origin: https://automobile-association.vercel.app. This request is not allowed from the current domain."` was occurring because:

1. **Root Cause**: The Vercel deployment domain `https://automobile-association.vercel.app` was not included in the production CORS origins list in `src/utils/securityConfig.ts`.

2. **Why it happened**: The application has client-side origin validation that checks if the current domain is allowed before making API requests. When deployed to Vercel, the validation failed because the Vercel domain wasn't in the approved production origins.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/utils/securityConfig.ts`

#### Added Vercel domain to production CORS origins:
```typescript
production: [
  'https://aauganda.co.ug',
  'https://www.aauganda.co.ug',
  'https://automobile-association.vercel.app' // ✅ Added this
]
```

#### Updated Content Security Policy:
```typescript
connect-src 'self' https://aauganda.co.ug https://automobile-association.vercel.app https://*.supabase.co https://*.supabase.io;
```

#### Enhanced API base URL configuration:
```typescript
baseUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || (
  isDevelopment 
    ? 'http://localhost:5173' 
    : (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.origin === 'https://automobile-association.vercel.app')
      ? 'https://automobile-association.vercel.app'
      : 'https://aauganda.co.ug'
)
```

#### Improved origin validation with better error logging:
```typescript
export const validateOrigin = (): boolean => {
  // Allow validation to pass during SSR or when window is not available
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
    return true
  }
  
  const currentOrigin = window.location.origin
  const isValid = isAllowedOrigin(currentOrigin)
  
  // Log validation attempts for debugging
  if (!isValid) {
    secureLog.error(`Origin validation failed for: ${currentOrigin}`)
    secureLog.error(`Allowed origins for ${isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production'}:`, 
      isDevelopment ? CORS_ORIGINS.development : CORS_ORIGINS.production)
  }
  
  return isValid
}
```

### 2. Updated `src/api/index.ts`

#### Enhanced error messaging:
```typescript
if (!validateOrigin()) {
  const currentOrigin = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.origin : 'unknown';
  const error = `Invalid origin: ${currentOrigin}. This request is not allowed from the current domain. Please contact support if this issue persists.`;
  // ... additional logging
}
```

#### Improved credentials handling:
```typescript
credentials: 'include', // Changed from 'same-origin' to better support cross-origin requests
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: The application should now successfully deploy without CORS errors
2. **Test IDP Application**: Try submitting an IDP application from the Vercel domain
3. **Test IDP Verification**: Try verifying an IDP number from the Vercel domain
4. **Check Console**: No origin validation errors should appear in the browser console

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Only trusted domains are allowed in production
- ✅ Development and production environments are properly separated
- ✅ Proper CSP headers are maintained
- ✅ Enhanced error logging for debugging
- ✅ SSR compatibility maintained

## Impact

- **Fixed**: CORS errors when accessing the application from Vercel deployment
- **Maintained**: All existing security measures
- **Enhanced**: Better error logging and debugging capabilities
- **Improved**: More flexible base URL configuration for different deployment environments

## Notes for Future Deployments

When deploying to additional domains, remember to:
1. Add the new domain to `CORS_ORIGINS.production` in `src/utils/securityConfig.ts`
2. Update the CSP `connect-src` directive if needed
3. Test the deployment thoroughly before going live
